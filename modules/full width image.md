natural dimensions of the image **can be larger, or smaller** than 640px, but the image will look sharper at exactly 640px wide (especially in outlook)

```html
<table width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td class="full-width-image">
            <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/640/310" width="640" alt="" />
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

```
